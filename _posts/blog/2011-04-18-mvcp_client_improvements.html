If you are using Melted, then you will be interested in some improvements I made to mvcp-client that lets you run MVCP commands and exit immediately. This is very handy for use in shell scripts at/cron jobs. Also, you can use it to send XML to the server. After updating, run mvcp-client -h to get usage help.
