I made a simple ruby script using the MLT API binding that enumerates all services of all plugins, fetches their metadata/documentation, and generates a wiki page. The results appear under the Services section of the <a href="http://www.mltframework.org/bin/view/MLT/Documentation">Documentation</a> page of the web site.<br />
<br />
Of course, do not forget that all of this is also available at the command line using melt -query.<br />
