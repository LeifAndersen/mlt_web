Janne Liljeblad recently announced the availability of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flowblade/">Flowblade</a> - a new video editor using MLT that he has quietly been working on since 2009!<br />
<br />
It is written in Python and GTK+ and is released under the GPLv3 license.&nbsp;Flowblade employs a "film style" or "insert editing" paradigm, maybe best known from Avid&nbsp;products. Therefore, its UI and workflow is quite a bit different than OpenShot.<br />
<br />
You can see a screencast video of it in action on Vimeo:&nbsp;<a href="http://vimeo.com/40929683">http://vimeo.com/40929683</a>
