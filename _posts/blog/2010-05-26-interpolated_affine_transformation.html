A popular feature request is to have smooth pan and zoom effects especially over photos for slideshows - a.k.a. the Ken Burns effect. This is currently exposed partially or in various ways in the applications using MLT, but it lacks the smoothness due to not supporting sub-pixel positioning and rendering. The last couple of evenings I have been working on adding interpolation and making other little changes to make it smooth for the next release. Here is a <a href="http://mltframework.org/mlt/panzoom.ogg">sample video</a> - please excuse the red-eye :-/
