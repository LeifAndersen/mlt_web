dorfTV, a community television station in Austria, has sponsored two enhancements to the decklink plugin. First is input support so you can capture and do live encoding. The second is support for keying, which makes the DeckLink hardware composite the MLT video output over live SDI video input with full alpha blending. You can get more information from the online help: melt -query producer=decklink &nbsp;or melt -query consumer=decklink.<br />
