<p>This is a minor revision of the TV Broadcasting multimedia toolkit for linux. Improvements are mainly in the area of ffmpeg and avformat integration. There are also updates to the live knoppix distribution (which should run on a variety of current distros such as mandrake 10 and redhat 9) and the fireswamp media player. More details can be found at http://mlt.sf.net</p>
