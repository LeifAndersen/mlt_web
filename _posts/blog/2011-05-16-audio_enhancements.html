<br />
Since the last release there have been four big enhancements in the area of audio:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Reading files with more than 2 channels of greater than 16-bit audio - including floating point.</li>
<li>Exposing each SoX effect as a separate audio filter making it possible to enumerate them and get metadata for them.</li>
<li>Exposing each LADSPA plugin as a separate audio filter with metadata so you no longer need to use JACK Rack XML.</li>
<li>Supporting JACK transport synchronization (melt -jack).</li>
</ul>
