You can download it from&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mlt/">SourceForge</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/releases/tag/v6.2.0">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;The major announcement is the&nbsp;introduction of support for <b>libavfilter</b>! This is still a work-in-progress.&nbsp;It is limited to FFmpeg 2.3 and up, and there are a number of filters that&nbsp;are black-listed because they are known to not integrate with MLT, which is&nbsp;not a full libav* environment or simple wrapper for it. There are likey&nbsp;avfilters that are not yet black-listed but might not work because they&nbsp;have not been completely tested. Also, they do not support MLT's keyframable&nbsp;property animation nor its frame-threaded parallelism due to architectural&nbsp;or integration limitations. However, some avfilters are slice-threaded&nbsp;(internal parallelism), and that works. Finally, libavfilter filtergraph&nbsp;syntax is not supported either.<br />

<div>
All of the supported libavfilters are exposed as MLT filters beginning with&nbsp;the prefix "avfilter." All of the avfilter parameters are exposed as MLT&nbsp;properties with the "av." prefix to prevent clashes with MLT properties.&nbsp;You can run</div>
<div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">melt -query filters</span> to see the new avfilters, and</div>
<div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">melt -query filter=avfilter.rotate</span>, for example, to view generated&nbsp;documentation for an individual filter.<br />
