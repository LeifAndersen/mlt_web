<br />
This is a minor release to fix a few things between the 0.7.0 release and the release of Kdenlive 0.8. I recommend Kdenlive v0.8 users to upgrade to this version of Mlt. Beyond that there are some exciting additions to the Blackmagic Design DeckLink plugin!<br />
<br />
Framework<br />
<ul>
<li>Added mlt_profile_list().</li>
</ul>
Modules<br />
<ul>
<li>Added decklink producer (i.e. capture, live encoding).</li>
<li>Added keyer output for decklink consumer.</li>
<li>Added AVOptions to the avformat service metadata.</li>
<li>Added support for new major API versions (53) of FFmpeg.</li>
</ul>
Melt<br />
<ul>
<li>Added '-query profile' option.</li>
<li>Added '-query formats', '-query audio_codecs' and '-query video_codecs'.</li>
</ul>
