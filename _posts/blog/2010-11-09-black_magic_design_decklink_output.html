I just added a consumer (output plugin) for DeckLink SDI and HDMI cards. Some of their cards have analog connections as well, and I think it works with those too. The way this is integrated, it can be enabled and built by default by your distribution (version after 0.5.10) such that if you get a card, you can just install the driver and library, and &nbsp;it will be ready to work with MLT. This means you can get an open source SDI playout solution for Linux for less than $300!
