Often people want to know how to set encoding parameters for MLT. So, I improved the service metadata for the avformat producer and consumer by improving their existing metadata and extending them with AVOptions from the FFmpeg/libav libraries. The <a href="http://www.mltframework.org/twiki/bin/view/MLT/ConsumerAvformat">result</a> is on the MLT website.<br />
<br />
This same information can be obtained from the command 'melt -query consumer=avformat'.<br />
