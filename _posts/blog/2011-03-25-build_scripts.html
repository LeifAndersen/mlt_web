I have <a href="http://www.mltframework.org/bin/view/MLT/BuildScripts">published some scripts</a> that can build and rebuild MLT, Melted, and Kdenlive and many of its multimedia dependencies (x264, libvpx, FFmpeg, frei0r). The script pulls the latest of each from their source code repositories on each build and rebuild. Each build is output to a dated folder without requiring any "system" installation, and the folder can be simply copied to other compatible machines and run again without any packaging or system installation.<br />
