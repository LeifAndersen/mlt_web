This is a minor maintenance release, but it is interesting because it now enables usage of libswscale as the default choice for image scaling, image format conversion, and color space conversion. That gives better quality and performance. In addition, there are some improvements in the sdl_preview consumer to make it suitable for use in OpenShot 1.1.
