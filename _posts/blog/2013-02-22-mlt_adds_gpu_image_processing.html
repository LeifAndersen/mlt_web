For a few months, we have been working on a set of image processing filters and transitions that utilize the OpenGL Shader Language (GLSL) of your video card/chip. This means that not only are they very fast but also cross-platform and widely supported. GLSL is generally faster and better supported than OpenCL and NVIDIA CUDA because those technologies are rather new or vendor-specific and designed for more general purpose computing. The new filters are also high quality by using 16-bit linear floating point per color component. All of this means that you can apply more effects without a huge reduction in frame rate.<br />
<br />
This work has now been merged into the master code branch and will be available in the next release. They have already been integrated into the <a href="http://www.shotcut.org/">Shotcut</a> daily builds for all 3 major OS platforms! However, a caveat - there is not much to see there yet because Shotcut does not yet have filters. :-) Nevertheless, it &nbsp;has served as a feasibility exercise of the cross-platform integration. Meanwhile, one can open a clip, save as XML, edit the XML to put something like &lt;filter mlt_service="movit.mirror"/&gt; inside of the &lt;producer&gt;&lt;/producer&gt;, open the XML in Shotcut, and see the result. But first you will need to enable GPU Processing in the Settings menu.<br />

<div>
We thank Christophe Thommeret for providing the proof-of-concept which provided many ideas about how to integrate something like this with MLT.</div>
<div>
We thank Steinar H. Gunderson for providing the new <a href="http://git.sesse.net/?p=movit">Movit</a> library, which is an external dependency that provides all of the heavy lifting here.</div>
