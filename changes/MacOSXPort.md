MLT was successfully compiled and runs under Mac OS X. The configuration
has been updated to detect the Darwin platform automatically. If you
want to do anything useful with it one has to use
\[\[http://www.macports.org\]\[MacPorts\]\] or any other free software
repository for Mac OS X to manage the dependencies.

TODO \* (done) <strike>Better SDL consumer or replacement to allow
embedding and resizing in non-X apps</strike> \* Change from dlopen to
the native Mac OS X dynamic loading of shared libraries (necessary?)
