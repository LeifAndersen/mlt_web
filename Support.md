If you need help with a bug, then please use the [bug tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=613414&group) on SourceForge.

Community support is available through:

- the [mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum), or
- the [mlt tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlt)

The old Disqus forum is closed because it is not searchable, and Stack
Overflow is such a strong developer community.

We have an [archive of the old Disqus forum](DisqusCategory)
because it contains some useful knowledge. This is not so useful and
interesting to browse, but at least threads may now appear in search
results.

Also, you may want to check the [FAQ]({{"/faq/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). ![Question]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/question.gif?raw=true)
