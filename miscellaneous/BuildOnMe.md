BuildOnMe is a cross-platform (Linux, Windows, BSD, Mac OS X)
Qt GUI that is a starter project in
source code form. You can use it as a starting point to build your own
MLT application. The source code is provided under the
[OSI MIT
License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), which means you can use it to make a free software, open
source, or proprietary application as long as you give credit or
attribute the the MLT project, which is already required to use MLT
under its LGPLv2.1 or GPLv2 license. The provided example is extremely
basic, but shows how to embed the MLT video window into the application
based on the platform and start playing a file.

You can get the latest version of the source code using:

`git clone git://github.com/mltframework/BuildOnMe.git` or `git clone
