[Blackmagic Design](http://www.blackmagic-design.com/) makes
[SDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Digital_Interface)
and HDMI peripherals for uncompressed audio and video input and output.
The SDI product line is named !DeckLink whereas the HDMI line is
Intensity; however, the HDMI came out after SDI and is backwards
compatible with the DeckLink API.
