## Plugin Information

title: Audio Waveform  
media types:
Video  
description: Generate audio waveforms.  
version: 1

## Bugs

* This does not work alone on audio-only clips. It must have video to overwrite. A workaround is to apply this to a multitrack with a color generator.
* The quality of the waveforms is not so good especially for high definition video.
